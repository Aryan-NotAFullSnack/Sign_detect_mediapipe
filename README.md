### Sign Language Detection with MediaPipe and Python – Because Who Needs Sleep Anyway?

So, here it is: a full-on sign language detection model powered by MediaPipe and Python, crafted in just 5 hours of pure coding chaos (and yes, coffee may have been involved). Who needs sanity when you have machine learning skills and a knack for deciphering hand gestures, right?

Sure, this might look easy, but don’t be fooled—it took a lot of debugging, a few existential crises, and some very patient datasets. I even squeezed out a research paper to top it off. But hey, if you're into rapid-fire AI projects that leave you questioning your life choices, feel free to dive in.
